        <h3>🌸 A Silent Voice</h3>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiNzRiOWEtYTQwNy00NmRiLWE0ZWYtNTE0YjExZjFmZjkwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="a silent voice poster" height="300" />
        <p>Beautiful animation, coupled with excellent storytelling. Shouya's charcter arc is quite an endearing one to watch and moves you to tears by the end of it (it did for me anyway 🙂).</p>

        <h3>☄️ Your Name</h3>

        <p>One of Makoto Shinkai's finest works. Each frame is a piece of art. Immaculate storytelling in a non-linear fashion. The viewer is left to interpret the happenings in the movie in their own way, either as magic, spiritual powers, sci-fi, or a combination of these.</p>

        <h3>👸 Princess Mononoke</h3>

        <p>Another classic Studio Ghibli movie by Hayao Miyazaki. A story that speaks volumes about how the biggest curse in the world is hate. A majority of the female characters portrayed in the film are powerful in their own way and live their lives with pride. I don't think we need to talk much about Ashitaka :) He's a gem 💎</p>

        <h3>🕵🏼 SpyxFamily (S1 & S2)</h3>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDkwNjc0NWEtNzJlOC00N2YwLTk4MjktZGFlZDE2Y2QzOWI0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="SpyxFamily poster" height="300" />
        <p>Can't wait till they actually become a family 🙂. Go Anya x Damian!</p>

        <h3>⚗️ The Apothecary Diaries (S1)</h3>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAxMmFjZjgtYjM1ZS00NzdmLTliZDktZmIyMzU5YTBlNDBmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="the Apothecary diaries poster" height="300" />
        <p>Beautiful story. Loved every interaction between Jinshi, Maomao and Gaoshun. The last episode is my favorite (Ep. 24) -- cried my eyes out 😅. <br/>
The 1st episode of S2 came out on 10th January. Can't wait till the rest of it is out (which will be by JUNE. Taking too long imo 🥲)</p>
